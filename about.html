                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>I am a current Junior at Duke University pursuing a major in computer science and minor in creative writing. In my computer science studies, my focus is on machine learning and AI. I deeply enjoy working on projects that allow me to apply my favorite aspects of both disciplines: building an aesthetic experience and deepening the relationship between the creator and the user. Ideally, I would like to employ my passions into developing technologies that utilize AI to foster deeper learning, sustainability, and connectivity, aiming to contribute to an ecosystem that encourages human flourishing instead of isolation. I have already found fulfillment working on a range of coding products that align with this goal— from developing a website to connect patients newly diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease to collaborating with a small team to enhance the experience of Duke’s students attending University sporting events. This past Summer, I worked as an Artificial Intelligence intern, developing accurate RAG applications for marketing purposes — a finished product that aligned with my passion for creating human-centric content. I look forward to continuing working on projects that inspire me and deepen my passion for the field. 

                    My experience as a mentor for elementary schoolers interested in STEM, coding tutor, working across internal teams as an AI intern, and member of a women in STEM leadership group have enhanced my ability to communicate effectively and flexibly within diverse teams. My extracurricular front-stack experience combined with the rigorous and backend-intensive computer science curriculum at Duke have also aided my flexibility, providing me with the tools to contribute to a project from any angle required. I can apply these skills as a software engineer on a range of teams. </p>
                    <p>Academically, I am also interested in philosophy, literature, and sociology. In each semester at Duke, my schedule is half STEM classes and half humanities classes. With this, I have been able to explore my interests in humanities through perspective-changing classes, for example: Bad Behaviour, where we examined ideas of deviance, wrongdoing, and misconduct in the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries; Human Flourishing in the Digital Age, where we learned how new technologies through the centuries have impacted human flourishing and how we should practically live in today's digital age.</p>
                    <p>Outside of school, I enjoy photography, reading, meditation, and vintage clothing shopping. To the side are some photos I took using my Canon G1x. </p>
